# Profile 

In the meantime, I have been working as an Automotive, Embedded Software Engineer (for 5 years). So I define myself as, having a total of eight years of software development and testing experience, including the last few years in Electrical/Electronic Architecture. 

I am always looking for an opportunity and a team where we can explore new technologies and smartly integrate them as safe and reliable embedded systems. I strongly believe in teamwork and follow the Agile development process as a professional skill. 

Professional with extensive knowledge and expertise in:
- Embedded Linux and C/C++, Python
- Driver development and kernel optimization
- Embedded application integration in Measurement devices (e.g., Oscilloscope) 
- Automotive Hypervisors and I/O virtualization ECU systems

Additional areas of expertise include:
- Deep learning and Digital Image Processing,
- AI in embedded devices(e.g., Oscilloscopes, ECU System),
- Safety and ADAS applications using digital image processing 
- CAN Bus
